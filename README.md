naming convention: snake_case
No need to add var
just
my_name="Aaradhya"

x=5
x=10
x,y,z=5,10,15

result=5+3
result=7-4
result=2*6
result=10/3 => 3.333
result=10//3 => 3
result=10%3 => 1
result=2**3 =>8

text: str
numeric: int float complex
sequence list, tuple, range
dict
frozenset
bool None



BuildIn

Text Type: str (Immutable)
Number: int float complex (Immutable)


Sequence Type
List can be treated as array but array cannot be trreated like list
Tuple: Immutible
Range: Only support number


Mapping Type: dict



Set(Mutable) vs frozenset(Immutable)

Boolean= true we cannot change to erue

None type: None


To Check Type
------------
x=5

print(type(x))


x= "Hello World"
x=20
x=20.5
x=ij
## Check all datatype



Slide: In a flow
Basic Project: For example rather than scratch
Revise
Slow and drawing.
Teach real life experiecne and advance, but in simple way. 
Ask Question. If i run this what will happen
Give an example then teach as per it.
Classwork. And check one by one. followup
Give homework and topic to research
Be open for unexpected question, rather ask to explain, you gotta be in feeback loop
OnQuestion on code ask Guessing then run
IDC. IK-All
Teach good coding standard
I taught input in class2, don't mean i should use it in class2, i can use in class 4 as HW/CW
Revise course fast vs Give time
